If you are using active dry yeast (look like small round balls) - follow the instructions given in the packet.If you are using fast action yeast (looks more like fine semolina) then in a large bowl combine the flours, salt and sugar and gradually add in the yeast and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding little flour if it tends to get sticky.
Once all of the ingredients form a ball; add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes.
Repeated kneading combines all the ingredients well and will help the bread rise well in the oven.Once you have finished kneading and gained enough arm muscle; place the dough in a large bowl coated with olive oil and cover it with cling wrap/plastic wrap and allow it to rise for about 2 hours.After two hours you will notice that the dough has doubled.
At this point punch the dough down and knead gently.
Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball.
Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes.While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C.
The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them.
Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread.
Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well.
Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle.
Make sure the pitas are thin; about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick.
Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven.
Bake the pita dough until they puff - you will see them rising forming bubbles, to slowly puffing and fully puffing up.The whole process takes a maximum or 3-5 minutes and not more than 5 minutes.

526,Dark Chocolate Sandesh (Shondesh) Dipped In Chocolate Recipe,"To begin making the Dark Chocolate Sandesh (Shondesh) Dipped In Chocolate Recipe, first prepare the chenna or fresh cottage cheese, which is the base for many Bengali sweets.To do this, place the full fat milk in a saucepan or heavy bottomed pan and bring it to a boil.
Once the milk is bubbling away, add the lemon juice and turn off the heat.
The milk will curdle and coagulate within seconds.Once the entire milk has coagulated and you see the cheese floating on top and a clear whey separated from it.
Prepare the chenna and rinse it under running water thoroughly.
Tie it in a cheese cloth and hang it to drain out the excess water.
This process takes at least for a couple of hours.In the meantime, chop the dark chocolate into small chunks to make it easier to melt.
Place a sauce pan with water over a medium heat.
In a heatproof bowl which is slightly larger than the saucepan, add the chopped chocolate and place this bowl over the saucepan, ensuring that the boiling water doesn’t touch the surface of the heatproof bowl.The heat generated by the boiling water will melt the chocolate gently.
Lower the heat and begin to melt the chocolate with a spatula, till it is smooth and glossy.Add the cocoa powder and vanilla essence to the melted chocolate and keep it aside.Time to check on the chenna once again.
Once most of the water is drained out, tip the cheese on a flat surface and begin kneading it, pressing it down and forward with the heel of your palm.Working it on the surface like you would dough for chapatis or puris.
The kneading is most important as it makes the chenna smooth, and almost like a fine paste by the end of the process.Note: If kneading the sondesh takes too much time and effort, you could also use a food processor.
However the result will be a finer paste-like sondesh, while this recipe tastes good when the chenna mix is well-kneaded, but slightly grainy.Reserving about 3 tablespoons of the melted chocolate in a smaller bowl, add the rest of the melted chocolate to the kneaded chenna.
Add the condensed milk and once again mix until it is well combined.Heat a heavy bottomed pan and tip the chenna mixture into it.
Cook on medium heat until the mixture begins to leave the sides of the pan and come together as a ball.Remove the mixture from the heat, add the raisins and mix well.
Once it is cool enough to work with, divide the chenna into 12 equal parts.
Shape them into round balls and lightly flatten each by patting them softly with your fingers.Dip half the balls in melted chocolate reserved separately earlier and top it off with roasted slivered almonds.
Place the balls chocolate side up, to set a little.Serve the Dark Chocolate Sandesh on Angoori Rasmalai.
